# The Idaho Bibliography Project

<p class="text-center h3 mb-3"><em>{{ site.tagline }}</em></p>

The Idaho Bibliography Project is intended to provide a comprehensive list of nonfiction about the state of Idaho--presented in a browseable website that encourages you to discover the unique books written about your local history.
The project was created with the assistance of the John Calhoun Smith Grant to support Idaho History Day.

In 2016, [University of Idaho Special Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/) Librarian Robert Perret travelled to nearly every library, museum, and historical society in the state to discover every available book about Idaho history. 
Many are not cataloged anywhere else! 

Did he miss your favorite nonfiction book? 
Email <rperret@uidaho.edu> to let him know! 
He is happy to add new books or update the list.

## About the Website

The items in this collection are based on the original [Idaho Bibliography Project site](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/idahobibliography/legacy/).
Book cover images and geo coordinates were added in 2021.

The current site was designed by U of I Digital Infrastructure Librarian Evan Peter Williamson using a [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) template.
Metadata about each book drives the interactive browsing features, allowing users to discover Idaho history!

Last updated March 2021.
