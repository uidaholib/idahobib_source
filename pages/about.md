## About the Idaho Bibliography Project

The Idaho Bibliography Project was created with the assistance of the John Calhoun Smith Grant to support Idaho History Day. In 2016, University of Idaho Special Collections Librarian Robert Perret travelled to nearly every library, museum, and historical society in the state to discover every available book about Idaho history. Many are not cataloged anywhere else! Did he miss your favorite nonfiction book? Email rperret@uidaho.edu to let him know! He is happy to add new books or update the list.

## About CollectionBuilder SA

CollectionBuilder-SA is a "Stand Alone" template for creating digital collection and exhibit websites using Jekyll, given:

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of images, PDFs, audio, or video files

Driven by your collection metadata, the template generates engaging visualizations to browse and explore your objects.
The resulting static site can be hosted on any basic web server.

[CollectionBuilder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/) is an set of open source tools for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology.
See [Getting Started Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/docs/introduction.html) for detailed information.
