## About the Idaho Bibliography Project

The Idaho Bibliography Project was created with the assistance of the John Calhoun Smith Grant to support Idaho History Day. 

In 2016, University of Idaho Special Collections Librarian Robert Perret travelled to nearly every library, museum, and historical society in the state to discover every available book about Idaho history. 
Many are not cataloged anywhere else! 

Did he miss your favorite nonfiction book? 
Email <rperret@uidaho.edu> to let him know! 
He is happy to add new books or update the list.
